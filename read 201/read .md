# Growth Mindset

*When people are improving their knowledge, intelligence and ability to learn new skills by hard work and insistence. They believe that learning doesn't stop the moment you leave work or studying.*


**We have two types of mindset people:**



|growth mindset|fixed mindset| 
|--------------|--------------|
|tend to achieve and learn more|believes their talents are innate gifts|



*When someone has a growth mindset, they believe that they can continue to learn and become more intelligent with effort.  In contrast, someone who has a fixed mindset believes that they are born with a certain amount of talent and intelligence and that cannot be improved no matter how much they try and put efforts.*

## ***Three reminders I can give myself for motivation and mind growth***

* *Always to write my goals and working on it.*
* *Always keep my motivation on the highest levels by doing and learning what I love.*
* *Always trains myself to not be afraid from failure as I can do it again and again till I succeed.*
