 ## **Images**

 •	You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.

```
img.large { 
width: 500px; 
height: 500px;} 
img.medium { 
width: 250px; 
height: 250px;}
img.small { 
width: 100px; 
height: 100px;}
```
•	Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS
```
img.align-left {
float: left;
margin-right: 10px;}
img.align-right {
float: right;
```
•	Background-image
The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.

•	You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.
•	shorthand background
The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the other background properties you have just seen, and also the background-color property.


## **Practical Information**

Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
Search engine optimization (or SEO) is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.

In every page of your website there are seven key places where can appear in order to improve its findability:

1.	Page Title
2.	URL / Web Address
3.	Headings
4.	Text
5.	Link Text
6.	Image Alt Text
7.	Page Descriptions

How to Identify Keywords and Phrases:

1: Brainstorm List down the words that someone might type into Google to find your site. Be sure to include the various topics, products or services your site is about.

2: Organize Group the keywords into separate lists for the different sections or categories of your website.

3: Research There are several tools that let you enter your keywords and then they will suggest additional keywords you might like to consider, such as: adwords.google.co.uk

4: Compare It is very unlikely that your site will appear at the top of the search results for every keyword. This is especially true for topics where there is a lot of competition.

5: Refine Now you need to pick which keywords you will focus on. These should always be the ones that are most relevant to each section of your site.

6: Map Now that you have a refined list of keywords, you know which have the most competition, and which ones are most relevant, it is time to start picking which keywords you will use for each page

## **Flash**

**Flash and JavaScript are based off ECMAScript. Anything you can do in Flash you can do in JavaScript. JavaScript is a full-featured programming language. It's used to create web applications, video games, particle systems, etc.**

* Whether you are creating an animation or a media player in Flash, the files you put on your website are referred to as Flash movies.

* Since 2005, a number of factors have meant that fewer websites are written in Flash or even use elements of Flash in their pages.
