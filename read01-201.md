## **Chap.1 Structure**

HTML language is Hypertext Markup Language that have a set of markup symbols or 
codes that we use it on the shape of tags on the HTML pages to create websites,
html pages are text documents which have codes are often referred to as elements,
html tags come in pairs whish start with < as a beginning and /> as an end,
opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element and all 
attributes require a name and a value.
To learn HTML, we need to learn the tags and where they can go.


## **Chap.8 Extra Markup**

**Doctypes**

Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a doctypes declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using. The use of a doctypes can also help the browser to render a page correctly.


**Comments in HTML**

comments are not visible to users in the main browser window, they can be viewed by anyone who looks at the source code behind the page, when you write your comments it will be easier to understand from your side and if someone else needs to look at the code.

**Id Attribute**

The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet, It is used by CSS and JavaScript to perform a certain task for a unique element.

**Div**

The div element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box. It can also make it easier to follow your code if you have used div elements to hold each section of the page.


## **Chap.17 HTML5 Layout**

The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure, to make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

**Headers & Footers**
The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
the header element used to contain the site name and the main navigation. The footer element contains copyright information.

**NAV**
The element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation. 

**Aside** 

the element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an element or not.

**Articles**
The article element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

**Sections**

A structural HTML element used to group together related elements. Each **section** typically includes one or more heading elements and additional elements presenting related content.

**Figures**
 
Usually, a figure is an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, Videos etc., that is referenced in the main flow of a document. 

**Linking Around**

This allows you to turn an entire block into a link.




## **Chap.18 Process & Design**

When decide to build your website you need to understand the target audience why will the cist your website and are they likely to return because of this you need to study about this before you start to design your site and after that you need organize all the information that you need to go on every page of you site, then you have to wireframe your site pages and then start to design and You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.


## **JS Chapter 1: The ABC of Programming**


**WRITING A SCRIPT**

to write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

  * DEFINE THE GOAL First, you need to define the task you want to achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve.
   * DESIGN THE SCRIPT To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle.

  * CODE EACH STEP Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.

**FROM STEPS TO CODE**

every step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be written in a language the computer can understand and follow.

**DEFINING A GOAL & DESIGNING THE SCRIPT**

**SKETCHING OUT THE TASKS IN A FLOWCHART**
to approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
