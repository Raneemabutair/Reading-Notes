*We have Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.*

*We can write Css in many ways :*

  *	Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.
  * Internal - by using a style element in the head section.
   * 	External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file.

   ## Color

   **Color can really bring your pages to life.** 

*The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:*

* 	RGB values which stand for ( red, green,blue)

 * HEX codes These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash #

 * color names.

 
It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
