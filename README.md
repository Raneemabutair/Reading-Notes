## **Lists, Tables & Forms**

In addition to the CSS properties covered in other chapters which work with the contents of all elements, there are several others that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.

* List markers can be given different appearances using the:

    * list-style-type
    * list-style-position
    * list-style


**Table** cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.

**Some Tables Properties:**

1.width to set the width of the table 

2.padding to set the space between the border of each table cell and its content

 3.text-transform to convert the content of the table headers to uppercase 

4.letter-spacing, font-size to add additional styling to the content of the table headers 

5.border-top, border-bottom to set borders above and below the table headers

 6.text-align to align the writing to the left of some table cells and to the right of the others
 
7.background-color to change the background color of the alternating table rows 

8.:hover to highlight a table row when a user's mouse goes over it.


## **Events**

JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page. When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window.


**Here is a list of some common HTML events:**

* onchange :	An HTML element has been changed
* onclick	The user clicks an HTML element
* onmouseover	The user moves the mouse over an HTML element

* onmouseout	The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
* onkeydown	The user pushes a keyboard key

* onload	The browser has finished loading the page

**Event handlers can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions:**

•	Things that should be done every time a page loads

•	Things that should be done when the page is closed

•	Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button

•	Content that should be verified when a user inputs data
