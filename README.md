# Jon Duckett JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY
## Intro & Scripts
JavaScript is a programming Language for the Web that can update and change both HTML and CSS by calculate, manipulate and validate data and make web pages more interactive.
When using JavaScript, you can easily:
 * ACCESS CONTENT   you can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example: Select any elements that have a class attribute with a value of note.
 * MODIFY CONTENT you can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example: change the value of class attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements.
 * PROGRAM RULES you can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example: a mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perform a ca loculation, and display repayments.
 * REACT TO EVENTS You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For example, it could be run when: a button is pressed, information is added to a form.

 ***The first steps of starting a website project are:***
 |DEFINE THE GOAL|DESIGN THE SCRIPT|CODE EACH STEP|
 |---------------|-----------------|--------------|
 


 
 ***what is a Script?*** *A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal, to approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task*

 ## Expressions + Operators
 **Expression evaluates into (results in) a single value, there are two types of Expression:**
  * EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE.
*It means that all the variable need to be given a value like:
Var name = “Raneem”; which is mean that the value of name now is raneem.*
* EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE.
*You can perform operations on any number of individual values to determine a single value like: 
Var account = 5*2;”; which is mean that the value of account now is 10* 

**Operators they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values there are two types of Operators:**

* ARITHMETI C OPERATORS arithmetic operators perform arithmetic on numbers and contains the following mathematical operators such as: *Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and a lot more*
* STRING OPERATOR when you may need to join two or more strings to create a single value for example: 
*var firstName = ‘Raneem ‘; 
var lastName = ' Abutair’; 
var ful l Name = f irstName + l astName;*


## Functions
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task,
javascript a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want.

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
